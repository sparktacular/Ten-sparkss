         <h1>Chapter 1. Filth</h1>
         <pre> The father leaned down, and his tired gaze leveled with the child's two-colored eyes. This gaze, like a wave, caused Kane a cool and growing feeling of shame, something one feels when they don't know what they’ve done wrong. This shame stuck like sea salt to dry skin after a day in the sun. Kane felt the coolness of his eyes especially strongly on their neck.

Valentine turned and stretched out his hand to the cabinet, taking out a small neckerchief. He handed it to Kane, piercing the child's eyes with a sullen look again. They took the neckerchief, understanding their father’s hint without a single word. They carefully tied it around their neck, covering the pink scar on it.

— Now you can go out into the world-

Valentine broke the silence with an empty voice.

Kane did not answer, only fixed their gaze on the floor, fiddling with the neckerchief with their fingers.

— When you get there, text me. I want to know where you are and how your day is going. I'll pick you up tonight, - the father paused and peered into the child's face, - it's for your own good, Kane. I know you don't understand... But that filthy thing on your neck is very dangerous.

— It's not filthy, Dad! - they interrupted the approaching lecture with a shout, - It's a gift, a gift from above! When I learn to use it, I, -

— You will never learn. Your power has not manifested itself, and you should be glad of it. If it does, the inevitable will be closer.

— I'm not her! Dad, listen! -

— Go to school, Kane.

A strong hand picked up the backpack and threw it into the child's hands unexpectedly roughly. The second hand pushed them out onto the landing, and the stone door slammed shut, after which Kane heard the turning of a key.

— And Kane, - a muffled voice said from behind the door, - no tricks. Please, just study.

There was no answer. Kane turned around and went outside.

Autumn. A cold September morning. The trees swayed to the beat of the music playing in the headphones. The wind raked through the hair, flew under the clothes, tried to pull the wide-brimmed purple hat off the head. The sun was not warm at all and lazily floated across the sky, occasionally getting caught in the webs of clouds.

A worn and faded pink poncho with a cherry brooch on the chest was a little too big. Underneath was a long T-shirt, which practically hid the pants, which only by a lucky chance matched the color of the poncho. Pink elbow-length fingerless gloves covered the consequences of school bullying on the wrists. Purple boots with berry patches completed the image of a teenager who was sure to attract disdainful glances wherever they went. But the cherry on top was the neon pink scar on the neck, forming exactly a half of a star. The neckerchief had long since left its place, allowing the owner of the mark to proudly flaunt it.

Kane walked slowly down the street, their body trembling like the leaves on the trees they were passing. Very little time had passed since moving to Stello, and today was the first day of the new school.

There was a crowd of people near the building - parents were dropping off their children.

Kane began to move through the crowd. Someone's foot suddenly appeared in front of theirs. Without noticing it, they tripped and started falling face down. However, they were saved from falling by the back of the girl standing in front of them. She turned around and looked with disgust at the stranger who dared to touch her. Kane had already opened their mouth to apologize, but the shrill voice of the savior made them change their mind.

— Watch where you're falling. A new one, I take it? Why are you so quiet? What's your name, ragamuffin?

— Kane. Kane Walker, - they smiled timidly.

— Where are you from? The garbage dump? - the girl loudly smirked to fill the silence caused by the fact that there was no one to laugh at her witty remark.

— No, I'm from Zvezdograd, - Kane looked her straight in the eyes.

— I can tell, - she grinned, assessing them with her gaze. Suddenly, her eyes caught on their neck, - You starriot, get out of here and go to your pigsty. People like you are not welcome here.

Kane covered the star with one hand, while the other reached for the father's neckerchief.

— It's too late to hide it! If you had covered this ugliness, maybe I would have shaken your hand. It's disgusting to even imagine, touching this filthy hand. Maybe there it is good that you...

But Kane was no longer listening. They smiled, turned around and walked back to the school gates. They wanted to run away from this place as quickly as possible.

As they approached a bench outside the school gate, Kane put their backpack on it and looked inside. A phone, a travel card, a sweater, a folding umbrella. They didn't have any money, but the contents of the backpack allowed them to spend the day as they wished. Father would hardly scold them for skipping school if he heard about that girl. He told them himself that if the bullying started at this school, he would switch to home schooling. Of course, this girl hadn't really done anything yet, but that's how it always starts.

Kane decided to head to the train station. Stello was huge, but even despite its size one could go around it entirely by train and even get to a large forest called Kuil, which occupied most of the eastern shore.

Kane began to slowly wander away from the school. The same autumn weather suddenly became pleasant for them, the breeze stopped being so bothersome, and even the need to hold the hat now amused them. The thought of a free day and a possible adventure sparked their imagination. To explore the city and its surroundings, maybe take a walk through an untouched forest or even meet someone new - all this sounded much more interesting than going through the torture that adults hide behind the cute word “school”.

As they boarded the train, Kane noticed an old woman handing out free newspapers. Out of interest, they took one. The headline of the article on the front page was written in even and strict letters, highlighted in red: “Another loss: already the ninth child missing.” The article went on to explain that for four years in a row, teenagers had been disappearing from the city one after another. Judging by the police reports, the last place where each of them was seen was the train station at the entrance to Kuil forest.

The train moved along the tracks. Kane was drawn into the story of missing children. They grabbed their phone out of a pocket and started researching news stories on the topic. The internet was helpful, but most of the websites were hidden.

— Researching the story of sparks?

A soft male voice pulled Kane out of their thoughts.

— Excuse me?

They turned to look at the source of it. Right behind them sat a person, completely wrapped in a black cloak. A thick hood of the same color completely covered his face, and the only thing visible was a long red lock of hair, slightly curling at the end. Around his waist was a rope belt with a clasp in the shape of a skull, and on his chest hung two threads holding the hood. The ends of these threads formed two halves of a star. On the back of his hand, a mark left by a star glistened. The scar was black.

— Rey,

The curious stranger extended a pale, thin hand towards Kane.

— Kane.

For a few seconds they considered whether it was worth touching someone who did not dare even show his face. However, politeness overcame doubts, and still they shook the hand. It was icy cold and gaunt. The touch was not simply unpleasant from the coolness of hands that had held the iron handrail for too long. It was a gravely cold, a biting frost that clung to Kane's fingers and refused to let go, like a mosquito that finally found an open patch of skin to suck on.

— I see that the Starfall did not go past you either. I noticed you back at school. Skipping on the first day, you hooligan?

A quiet nervous giggle fell from the lips hiding behind the hood.

Kane freed their hand from Rey's tight grip.

— To tell you the truth, I was not very politely received there. You are right, the starfall was extremely cruel to me, leaving its mark in such a visible place.

— Pink? I haven't seen that color in a long time.

He reached out and touched the star mark on Kane's neck. The icy sting of his fingers dug into it, causing them to jerk to the side.

— I've never seen a black one before either. So what's with the sparks?

Rey stood up and moved to the seat next to Kane, making them shudder.

— Urban legend. How long have you been in Stello?

— My father and I just moved here. We only had time to look around and settle in.

— Then you probably don't know that this city is the only one in all of Friderika where they hate stars, - the guy took a black glove out of his pocket and pulled it over his hand, hiding the star behind a layer of fabric, - It's better not to show that mark here. Otherwise, they might beat you up. It's understandable that they immediately treated you with hostility at school, your appearance literally screams: "Hit me!" People like you and I are called "starriots" here.

— But I don't even have magic,

Kane sighed sadly, looking out the window, where the trees and fences of this wonderful city were flying by.

— Impossible. Everyone who has a star has magic. You just need to awaken it. So, about the sparks. Sparks are the name of these missing children. They all have stars. For some unknown reason, they disappeared without a trace after crossing the border of the Kuil forest. Now there are nine of them. Nine sparks. So, Kane Walker, do you want to become the tenth one? -

This question was followed by another nervous giggle of the new accquaintance. Kane felt the cold run on their back. However, Rey's story aroused their genuine interest.

— What else do you know about these "Sparks"?

They looked at him, trying to look under the hood in search for his eyes.

— Why ask if you can see for yourself?

Kuil Forest. Final station.>

A voice broke out of the speakers. Suddenly, Rey's hand dug into Kane's palm, trapping it. The guy swiftly got up and almost flew out of the train, pulling his victim along.

Kane fell out of the mechanical doors, barely managing to grab the newspaper and their backpack. The hand instinctively moved to their head, pressing the hat tightly into it.

— Wait!

Kane turned around, helplessly watching the departing train. Suddenly, the feeling of the icy palm squeezing their hand disappeared. They looked back to where the disturber of their peace had just stood, but there was no one there anymore.

Kane looked around. The station was old and unkempt. There had clearly been no one willing to monitor its condition for a long time. Old leaves and dirt covered the wooden floors, the old covers from the wind were clearly no longer of any use. The bench, which was hardly fit for sitting on anymore, had graffiti and small drawings all over it. Old rusty nails stuck out of the armrests, the wood was black in some places, and vines were entwined around it. However, some of the writing on it looked new.

Looking at them, Kane noticed that “Rey” was written in black marker on the bench in a beautiful, curvy handwriting, and next to it was a star that had been completely painted over.

The other writing was barely legible - it was washed out by the rain, cracked and clearly old. However, one more drawing was discernible - half a star. Kane looked closer at it and realized - it was exactly like their scar, but mirrored. This was the other half of their star.
           </pre> </div>
             <div id="Chapter 2">
<h1> Chapter 2: Aground </h1>
  <pre>After standing at the station for a few minutes, unsuccessfully searching for their new acquaintance in the silhouettes of the trees, Kane decided not to waste their time waiting for the next train. Despite the fact that the forest that appeared before them was full of danger, especially if they were to believe the news and Rey's story, Kane still wanted to finally feel what it was like to make a decision on their own. Today, that decision was skipping the first day of school. However, they wanted to wait and see just how far they could go in the freedom they had finally acquired.

Kane remembered their father. Valentine Walker, who took them from their hometown, Zvezdograd. Deprived Kane of their mage friends, the opportunity to understand their powers, a place where they were accepted as they were, and most importantly - a home where the warmth that their mother once filled it with was still in the air. Now all that was left of her and of that happy time when she was near them was a hat. A hat with a pink velvet ribbon, carefully sewn by the mother's hand to thick purple velveteen. This item gave Kane strength, filled them with a sense of confidence, pride even. A headdress that once belonged to their mother, who was endowed with magical powers, just like them.

Kane's mother's scar was located on her chest, very close to her heart. Kane knew this for sure because in the last years of her life, her entire chest and neck were covered in dark purple stripes. These stripes sucked the life out of her, spreading more and more throughout her body. None of the doctors and magic experts in Zvezdograd could figure out the cause of this disease, and the family did not have enough money to travel to Wangow, the capital of the island. So, day after day, Kane watched as life was leaving their mother. She did not allow this to let her child doubt that their star was a gift from above. Every day, she told them about the first time she received the star, and how the power helped her see the best in people, inspire and protect them. Kane never understood what kind of power their mother had. Yet that mystery was not that far from being solved, as the star of their mother was the same color as their own - pink.

After their her death, the father changed a lot. From open and sociable, he turned into anxious, sullen and silent. Every day, coming to the table, Kane observed the man made of stone. His movements became restricted, almost mechanical, his face never showed any emotion, and only the weak movements of his bushy eyebrows let the child understand what mood he was in. No matter how hard Kane tried to reach him, crack this stone shell, talk to him, make the stone smile again, they felt only one thing - whatever their fathee was before, was now walled up in layers of solid rock. Valentine became an anchor, silently holding the ship named Kane in the cozy bay of their home in Zvezdograd. What he didn't notice, however, was that the crew had long since spread the sails, and the gusts of tailwind were pulling the ship out to sea, and it was only held back by the anchor that has taken root in the underwater soil.

This realization came to Valentine only when he found Kane playing with their friends. The child's star was shining on their neck, as if resonating with the stars of the others. Despite how happy Kane seemed, fear took hold of the father. Within a week, Kane was put in a car, and without any explanation, them and her father left Zvezdograd. Several silent hours in the car, an exhaustingly long inspection at the border, a strict briefing that the tired teenage brain did not even have time to process, and Kane found themselves in the city of Stello - the most closed settlement on the entire island of Friderika. In Valentine's mind, moving the ship to a closed harbor would hide it from the open sea, and soon the crew would forget how to keep it afloat, and the anchor would become overgrown with seaweed, which would force the captain to abandon their duty forever.

But now there was a loophole in front of Kane. A door, carelessly left open, through which a favorable wind rushed in, having searched for so long for sails that it could inflate, and the ship was ready to set sail again, having finally cut its anchor off. This loophole was a magical forest, unfenced, open to visitors and holding nine missing children. And not just children, but mages, bearers of stars.

Kane looked around. Having searched the entire station one last time, they turned their gaze to the piece of wood with a half of a star painted on it. Staring at it, they were lost in their thoughts, when their attention was drawn to the vines twining around the bench.

Friderika, a small island with the largest magical population, was located slightly south of New Zealand. This location allowed the island to maintain a cool climate. Despite the fact that Stello was located in the northeast of the island, it retained these weather conditions. The vines that were firmly clinging to the bench clearly did not belong to this forest. Moreover, a strange energy emanated from them. In the past, being surrounded by mages, Kane had heard about a magical aura, but never before had they felt it for themselves. A greenish haze enveloped the unusual plant and stretched along it towards the intertwining trees lying in front of the traveler.

The ability to blend in so harmoniously with the surroundings showed that whatever left these vines here was quite powerful. This sparked an idea. According to Rey, Kane had a chance to learn valuable skills first-hand - an opportunity that their father had taken away from them when they left their hometown. It was not something to pass up, and Kane confidently walked forward.

The vines led Kane deeper into the forest. Their legs began to itch, and the autumn colors of the forest started dazzling their eyes, mixing in their head, throwing them off the pace. Their stomach growled, their mouth was dry, and fatigue attacked them For a second, it seemed as if their shadow smiled at them.

An unusual picture appeared before them - a perfect circle of mushrooms, as if forming a place for a pair of legs in the middle. The feeling of the aura intensified, and Kane felt it with their nose. A bright aroma of juniper, mixed with notes of orange and undertones of fresh-after-the-rain grass. An unusual feeling, the ability to touch magic and grab onto it, caused Kane to tremble. Never before had they been so close to understanding this part of themselves. Decisively, they stepped into the unusual circle and looked around. At first it seemed to them that the idea was stupid. This realization came to mind somehow too quickly, sobriety of mind suddenly penetrated into the drunken head like a refreshing sea breeze. However, a new wave of exhaustion came after it with even greater speed. Looking up at the sky, Kane peered into the treetops that blocked the sun. They stretched out their hands when they noticed that a green aura had surrounded their entire body, as it was coming from those very mushrooms. The aura had become so dense that it felt like a layer of web, it seemed that if they were to touch it, it would stay on their palm.

Their eyes involuntarily closed, succumbing to this influence. Their neck ached as if hundreds of needles were stuck into it. Kane realized that their legs started to bend and stopped following their orders, when suddenly they saw a silhouette in the trees.

— Rey? Rey, is that you? Help me, please! I feel so bad,-

They stretched out their hands towards the silhouette.

— I'm not Rey, but you have nothing to be afraid of, - a gentle voice responded - freeze, and I'll get you out of there.

Kane did as they were told. Fatigue blurred their vision, and they couldn't see their savior.

— Close your eyes,- the voice commanded,- Otherwise the pores will put you to sleep completely.

The eyelids slammed shut on their own, obeying the order. A small, warm hand grabbed Kane's arm and pulled it towards itself. The legs started walking. Their owner didn't even notice in which direction they were being led.

— Follow me, it's dangerous to be alone here.

— But where are we going?

— Far from the mushroom circle. I'm saving you.

Kane blinked several times, and their eyes finally opened.

At first there was confusion, because there was no one in front of them. The sleepy brain refused to think, but the idea of looking down still reached it, and they lowered their gaze. The first thing that caught their eye was the light brown hair, and then the pale skin of the hand that was tightly holding theirs. The savioress was wearing a green summer sarafan. On her feet were bast shoes, as if she had woven them herself. But the most unusual thing was, undoubtedly, the complete absence of a right hand, which at the same time did not attract attention as something unnatural.

— What's your...

— No talking.

Despite the protest of Kane’s mind, their lips closed and only a quiet grumble escaped Kane's mouth. The sensation of the aura dissipated, and the fresh air of the untouched forest allowed their consciousness to clear up. Soon, a glade appeared ahead. There were many mushrooms on it, including the ill-fated ones with the red hats and little white dots, which made their victim wary.

— Don't be afraid, only those in the circle were poisoned... - the savior's voice softened, - please, sit down, eat calmly... You must be exhausted after exposure to the pores. This happens, but it's nothing to be afraid of.

Before Kane had time to draw the attention to the fact that there was nowhere to sit, the girl pointed to the side where the set table stood.

— Do you live here? - Kane obediently sat down on a chair, which was actually a large mushroom, - and, well, what is your name? I am Kane.

— My name is Elfis, and yes, I live here, on this glade. I know a lot about plants, and the forest gives me everything I could possibly need.

The table was set luxuriously, especially for forest conditions. Wicker herb plates, wood-carved cutlery, and most importantly — food. None of it smelled like meat, but just looking at the plates made one’s mouth water. Mushrooms, fresh vegetables, dried herb seasonings, plump fruits, and tea made from freshly collected mint. The table was bursting with food and reminded Kane of how loud the growling of their stomach was.

— Nice to meet you, Elfis! Thank you very much for saving me. Do you really not mind if I eat your food?
— Nice to meet you too, Kane. Of course I don’t mind. After such an impact, you clearly need to have some food to restore your strength. Go on, eat.

The last word was said in such a commanding tone that the victim of the mushroom circle did not notice as they began to chew. The mushrooms were cooked to perfection - fried chanterelles with potatoes were a long-time favorite, but a forgotten dish for them.

— While you eat, tell me how you got here,

Kane barely had time to chew their food when they suddenly started talking so quickly they almost did not have time to think about what it is thet were saying.

— I came here by train! But I'm here by accident! I just wanted to walk around Stello! I'm new here! We just moved! And... and my father wouldn't let me go for a walk here! Now I have an opportunity! I'm a mage, I have a star, but it doesn't work! And that's only a half! And there's a bench at the station! The other half of my star is on the bench! And Rey pushed me out of the train...

— That's enough, calm down now,-

Only these words allowed them to finally fall silent.

— A star, you say? Why yes, I see a scar on your neck.. Lift your head up.

Their chin obediently reached for the sky, revealing to her new acquaintance a view of the shining pink scar.

— It is true, only a half.. How is that possible?-
Elfis' eyes expressed sincere shock. She came up and touched the scar, but nothing happened, which seemed to surprise her even more.

— I don't know! It doesn't work.. I've never had abilities. But here.. when I approached the mushrooms, green energy was coming from them.

Kane looked at her with hope in their eyes, expecting some answers. It seemed to them that a person who could survive so well in a magical forest should know something about the stars.

— It doesn't work, then? And you say the other half is on the bench in the forest?

— Exactly, identical..-
Kane didn't have time to finish speaking, when a green haze of aura hit them right in the nose, and their eyes involuntarily closed. Suddenly, they felt something begin to curl around their body, tying them to the chair and restricting their movements.

— Elfis?-
They whispered.

There was no response, but instead, something sharp pressed like a needle on the scar on their neck.

Having opened their eyes, Kane saw that the very vines they had seen at the beginning of their journey, and along which they had come to those very mushrooms from which Elfis had saved them, were slowly growing from her right shoulder.

When the arm was fully formed, the vines revealed a scar on her shoulder. A green mark in the shape of a star shone brightly as she was using the power. It was carved like ac cut in the bark of a tree, its edges uneven.

Moreover, a mushroom hat had grown on her head, partially obscuring her face. Elfis' eyes glowed green, radiating the aura. Finally, Kane realized that the maze had slammed shut as soon as they stepped into this fey trap.

— You are enough of a mage to get into the forest. But are you enough of a non-mage to get out of here? You will show me the way out of the forest. Is that clear?

Kane looked fearfully at Elfis, who had just so kindly offered them food, and was now holding them with wooden vines.

— Yes, of course, but I don't know the way back!

— I will take you to the mushroom circle, and you will go back the way you came. Let's go.

Suddenly, Kane's eyes were covered with leaves, and the vines pulled them forward, lifting them from their chair. They had noticed how quietly Elfis moved when they first met, but now, without the ability to see her, they could only locate themselves by where they were being pulled, because the sorceress's silent steps were untraceable.

The leaves only came off when the thick green haze hit Kane’s nose again, causing fatigue. They opened their eyes and looked around, staring down at the witch's circle. They noticed their footprints there. Shaking their head, they turned around and started following back their own footsteps. Elfis followed them. Her face reflected doubt, and she sometimes broke into an impatient run.

— What makes you so sure we're going in the right direction? - She reached out to their shoulder, grabbing the poncho and pulling it towards her. Her voice shook slightly, and her quick steps were replaced by small, nervous jumps, allowing her to keep up with her captive.

Kane turned their head slightly and tilted it, looking into her eyes. Only now did they notice how much fear her gaze was showing. She shifted from foot to foot and looked away, nervously fiddling with their clothes.

— Don't worry, I know where we're going. Do you see the footprints?

Kane smiled and pointed to the ground, put a hand on the girl’s shoulder. However, instead of calm, the girl's eyes showed rage, and a magical hand grabbed Kane by the neck, pressing them back into the tree with a blow.

— You must think I'm an idiot if you think I couldn't get out by following the footprints! However, there are none on the ground, and don't ever think about trying to lie to me again!-

With each word she said, the hand grew larger.

Kane was taken aback and closed their eyes from the blow they received, after which they began to shake their head.

— No, no, I'm not lying! Look at it yourself! Footprints are on the ground, I swear to you!

Elfis looked at the ground, not even thinking about loosening her grip. She looked up at Kane again, and a small branch grew out of the hand holding them, slapping its victim on the face.

— There are no tracks here!

— But I can see them! I'm following them!

Kane wanted to continue screaming when they noticed tears welling up in Elfis' eyes. She dropped to the ground, right where the object of her search was, and began running her hand along the ground. The trail was washed away by her actions, and palm prints remained on the ground. The other hand let go of Kane and covered its owner's face.

Kane approached her and placed their hand on her back.

— Can't you really see them, Elfis?

The girl sobbed and shook her head in .

— So I got lost here... When I entered the forest, I thought that I would simply follow my own tracks. But it was night and there were no tracks to be seen... In the morning, I followed the road as I remembered it, but I couldn't find the exit.

The girl sobbed and nodded her head.

— I got lost here... When I entered the forest, I thought that I would simply follow my own tracks. But it was night time and there were no tracks to be seen... In the morning, I followed the road as I remembered it, but I did not find the exit.

— I will get us out of here! Before the tracks dry up and disappear, you and I will leave the forest! Let's go, Elfis. You don't need to force me, I want to help!-

Kane took Elfis' hand and pulled on it, helping her stand up. She rose to her feet and tightly wrapped her fingers around their palm. Together, they walked forward along the tracks that were visible only to one of them.

After a few minutes, Kane's confidence began to shatter. They walked straight along the path they had trampled, but it felt like it was circling around. And indeed, soon the gods-forsaken mushrooms appeared before them again.

Thinking that these were simply the wrong tracks, Kane continued on, slightly accelerating from the worry that had arisen. Elfis' tiny steps also quickened, as did the quiet sniffling of her nose.

They went around this circle two more times. Kane stopped at the mushrooms again and turned around. A strange picture appeared before them - the forest seemed to be shifting: the crowns of the trees were changing their shapes, and new branches were growing from their roots. A shiver wandered through their body, and their eyes began to run over the changing landscape. The ship named Kane realized that it had run aground.

— I knew it, - Elfis sighed, - The forest is changing its shape, right?

Kane nodded silently. Fear took hold of them. If they really had been following the right tracks all this time, then there was no way out of the forest.

Suddenly, something cold grabbed them by the neck and knocked them to the ground. It was Elfis. Her magical hand grew again and dug a sharp claw into Kane's scar.

— So your star still holds its powers. I'll take it and bring it to its true owner, and we'll get out. Don't resist, and it won't hurt.

But it did hurt. The vines began to strangle Kane. At some point, everything went dark before their eyes. They stretched their hands forward and grabbed with all their might at what was depriving them of oxygen.

— Elfis... let go...-

These words sounded only in their head.

— Kane, don't let her take me!

Kane's eyes opened again. It was quiet and dark all around, as if they were hanging in the air. Something bright and pink was shining in front of them. This something was shimmering, and tongues of fire were coming out of it. Kane realized that this thing had eyes that looked straight at them, and small arms reaching for them. Despite the flames, the creature kept a constant shape. It looked like a tadpole, but its head and tail had ridges.

— Elfis is going to take me away from you! Fight it!

They wanted to ask the creature what it meant, but they couldn't squeeze a word out.

— Use your power! Defend yourself, Kane!

Suddenly, Kane’s star flew out of their neck, and the fire flew confidently towards it. They stretched out their hands in fear and tried to grab the star and block it from this creature, when suddenly a light hit them in the eyes.

The forest landscape appeared before them again, as did the familiar mushroom hat. Its owner’s face reflected fear, she covered herself with vines and looked up, not into their eyes.

Kane realized they were standing up and suddenly felt a stream of energy directed straight at their head. Their hand was extended forward and above it was half a star, radiating a pink aura. They grabbed the star and directed it back at their neck when they felt an even stronger stream of magical mist flowing from above. Looking up, they noticed that their hat was hovering slightly above their head, and something resembling a barrier was coming out of it, preventing the vines that had latched onto it from getting to them. Kane realized what it was - they were using their magic for the first time in their life.
